# LuaCG
Make your lua code harder to read by obfuscating it, can be easily reversed. Do not relay on this to protect your scripts/code. 

## Features
* local variables rename
* minify(removes comments and new lines)
* strings to bytecode(idea from XFuscator)
* code "enc" to hex (uses load)
* code "enc" to binary (uses load)

# Todo
* str to byte, level 1 index from table, level 2 no table usage
* junk code


 Thanks to LuaMinify!
